# MPC-CSI: NBA Data Statistical Analysis 🏀

This repository contains a semester project for the course **MPC-CSI (Digital Signals and Systems)**, taught at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication (FEEC) at the Brno University of Technology (BUT).

## 📋 Project Description

The goal of this project is the practical application of mathematical statistics methods on real-world data. An **NBA (National Basketball Association) player statistics dataset** was chosen for the analysis.

The project demonstrates data processing within the MATLAB environment, ranging from data import to the visualization of results.

### Key Analysis Points:
* **Data Import & Preparation:** Loading the basketball statistics database.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of basic characteristics (mean, variance, standard deviation) for selected parameters (e.g., points per game, shooting percentage).
* **Distribution Analysis:** Creation of histograms and Probability Density Function (PDF) estimation.
* **Visualization:** Graphical representation of statistical phenomena using an interactive Live Script.

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **`StatistikaCalabek237881.mlx`** – The main project file (MATLAB Live Script). It contains:
    * Source code for calculations.
    * Explanatory text and methodology.
    * Generated graphs and output tables.
* **`LICENSE`** – Project license (MIT).

## 🛠️ Requirements and Usage

To open and run the project with full interactivity, the following software is required:
1.  **MATLAB** (a version supporting `.mlx` files).
2.  **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** (recommended for advanced statistical functions).

**How to run:**
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `StatistikaCalabek237881.mlx` file in MATLAB.
3.  Run the script (click *Run All*) to load the data and generate the charts.
